# ALS-FTD

## Introduction
With CITELINE, a platform that registers drugs and clinical trials in the pharmaceutical market, 962 clinical trials for ALS, FTD, or both disorders were identified. This project explores the probability of success (POS) of clinical trials associated with ALS and FTD, examining key factors such as trial protocols, trial design, and drug targets. Understanding the factors that impact the probability of success can improve the trial process and accelerate drug development for ALS and FTD.
